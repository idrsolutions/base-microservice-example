# Base Microservice Example
This is the base project for all our microservices. It handles all common actions used by our JPedal, BuildVu, FormVu microservices. This includes receiving requests and files sent to the service, polling of the service, handling call backs, and  parsing settings. Anyone can use this as a base to create a microservice.
